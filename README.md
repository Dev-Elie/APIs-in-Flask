# Python flask `API`

Building apps with `flask` is amazing

>### To run the app in development
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ export FLASK_APP=wsgi.py # optional as flask picks {app,wsqi,asgi}.py by default (A bit redurndant but worth it)
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run # python3 wsgi.py
$
```
